# Credit Score Prediction
# Overview
This repository contains the Credit Score Prediction project, which aims to predict individuals' credit scores based on various financial and demographic factors. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and provide insights into creditworthiness, helping lenders make informed decisions.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between features and credit scores to identify key predictors.
Model Training: Implement various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict credit scores.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
Demographic details (age, income, employment status)
Financial history (loan amounts, payment history, credit utilization)
Credit scores (target variable)
# Project Goals
Predict Credit Scores: Develop a model to accurately predict credit scores based on input features.
Identify Key Factors: Determine which factors most significantly impact credit scores.
Provide Insights: Offer insights to lenders for better decision-making in credit approvals.
